This script only works with human or humanoid rigs that have two legs and two arms.

Update: <br>
The names of the locators are based on the highest group name in your hierarchy, so make sure to rename your group correctly before creating the locators. <br>
Example: Jimmy_rig -> Arm_FK_Jimmy_rig_loc_R

Now, the IK/FK switch works with multiple rigs at the same time, and it also works if the rigs are imported as references. <br>
A window opens asking which locator names you want to switch. <br>
Example: In the scene, there are Arm_FK_PKPK_loc_R, Arm_FK_XUXU1_loc_R, Arm_FK_XUXU2_loc_R, Arm_FK_BABA1_loc_R, and Arm_FK_BABA2_loc_R. The window will allow you to choose between PKPK, XUXU, or BABA.

How it works: <br>
Works with a rig that has 3 IK FK SK joint chains.

Step 1: <br>
Find the IK joint chains. Select an IK joint chain in order (Shoulder -> Elbow -> Wrist for arms / Hip -> Knee -> Ankle for legs) and then place the basic locators (script: locIKFK). <br>
Repeat the action on Arm_L, Arm_R, Leg_L, and Leg_R.

Step 2: <br>
Now select the "FK_wrist" joint so the IK control can snap to it.<br>
Warning !!! <br>
With AdvancedSkeleton, the IK controls do not have the same pivot point as the joints. In this case: select your IK control, run the locIKFK script, then change the name of the Locator so that it is in IK mode, not FK (Ex : Leg_FK_gazelle1_loc_R to Leg_IK_gazelle1_loc_R). Then, delete the parent constraint of the locator and create a new parent constraint from the "FK_wrist" joint to your Locator.

Step 3: <br>
Select an FK joint chain and run the LocPV script. Repeat the action on all IK joint chains: Arm_L, Arm_R, Leg_L, and Leg_R.

Now, you can do whatever you want with the created locators, group them and store them in the rig group or wherever, just donâ€™t delete them.

SwitchIkFk: <br>
The IK switch works only if 2 or 4 IK controls are selected. It is effective when the following controls are selected in this exact order: PV_ctrl -> IK_ctrl.

The FK switch works only if 3 or 6 FK controls are selected. It is effective when selected in the parent-to-child hierarchy order: Shoulder_ctrl -> Elbow_ctrl -> Wrist_ctrl / Hip_ctrl -> Knee_ctrl -> Ankle_ctrl.

Good animating :)
